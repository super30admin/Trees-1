FAQ-
Why do you need two traversals? Can you do with a single traversal?
There can be multiple possible trees from just one traversal. That's why we need at least two traversals.


Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is
the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

Example 1:
Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Example 2:
Input: preorder = [-1], inorder = [-1]
Output: [-1]

Constraints:
1 <= preorder.length <= 3000
inorder.length == preorder.length
-3000 <= preorder[i], inorder[i] <= 3000
preorder and inorder consist of unique values.
Each value of inorder also appears in preorder.
preorder is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of the tree.
inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.

    Ideation - Using Hashmap O(N)
    
    We can reduce the time of finding the root in Inorder for each element in the tree by adding it to hashmap.
    To make the TC O(N), we need to also reduce generating sub arrays for inorder and preorder.
    So what we can do is, once you know the index of the root, you can make recursive call for left and right by sending
    the index, start and end, in the recursion. 
    Also increment preorder index by 1 after each node is visited. Doing so in preorder, we keep going to left, left
    then right, which is what preorder does. Refer lecture if it doesn't make sense.
