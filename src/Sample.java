// Time Complexity : O(h) i.e. h-->height of the tree
// Space Complexity : O(n)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Three line explanation of solution in plain english

//Used stack to iterate the whole tree
//pop it when the node hits null
//check the prev val with root val if its greater/equal then return false
//else return true
